## A

### Admin
The public key that owns and controls a Settings account. Only the admin can update settings or transfer ownership.

### Anchor
A framework for Solana smart contract development that simplifies account serialization, error handling, and testing.

## C

### Callback
An instruction in your program that Range calls after successful verification when using `verify_range_with_callback`. The callback receives `cpi_data` and `remaining_accounts`.

### CPI (Cross-Program Invocation)
The mechanism by which one Solana program calls another. Range supports both being called via CPI and making CPI calls to other programs.

### cpi_data
Arbitrary bytes passed from `verify_range_with_callback` to your callback instruction. You define the format and meaning.

## E

### Ed25519
The digital signature algorithm used by Solana and Range. Provides 128-bit security level for signature verification.

### Event
Data emitted by a Solana program during execution. Range emits `VerificationSuccess` events on successful verification.

## I

### IDL (Interface Definition Language)
A JSON file describing a Solana program's instructions, accounts, and types. Used by Codama to generate type-safe clients.

### Instructions Sysvar
A special Solana account (`SysvarInstructions111111111111111111111`) that provides information about the current transaction's instructions. Used for CPI verification.

## M

### Message
The data signed by the backend and verified on-chain. Default format: `{timestamp}_{pubkey}`. Can be extended with additional fields.

## P

### PDA (Program Derived Address)
An address deterministically derived from seeds and a program ID. Cannot have a corresponding private key. Range Settings accounts are PDAs derived from `["settings", admin_pubkey]`.

### Pubkey
Short for "public key." A 32-byte identifier for accounts and signers on Solana, typically displayed in Base58 encoding.

## R

### range_signer
The public key of the trusted backend signer stored in a Settings account. Only signatures from this key are accepted for verification.

### remaining_accounts
Additional accounts passed to `verify_range_with_callback` that are forwarded to your callback instruction. Access them by index in your `on_verify` handler.

### Replay Attack
An attack where a valid signature is reused after its intended use. Range mitigates this with timestamp validation within `window_size`.

## S

### Settings
The account type that stores Range configuration: `bump`, `admin`, `window_size`, and `range_signer`. Each admin has their own Settings PDA.

### Signature
A 64-byte Ed25519 digital signature created by the backend and verified on-chain. Proves the message was signed by the `range_signer`.

### Signer
The account that signs a transaction. In Range verification, the transaction signer must match the pubkey in the signed message.

## T

### Timestamp
Unix timestamp (seconds since epoch) included in the signed message. Must be within `window_size` of the current on-chain time.

## V

### VerificationSuccess
Event emitted when `verify_range` or `verify_range_with_callback` succeeds. Contains `signer`, `timestamp`, `signature`, `message`, `clock_slot`, `clock_timestamp`, and `settings_admin`.

### verify_range
The core verification instruction. Verifies a backend-signed message without triggering a callback.

### verify_range_with_callback
Verification instruction that calls your program after successful verification. Enables atomic verification + action patterns.

## W

### window_size
Configuration in Settings that determines how long (in seconds) a signature remains valid. Smaller values are more secure but less tolerant of latency.
